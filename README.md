# Gene Design - CompositionToDNA

Implemented an algorithm to choose a ribosome binding site given a peptide, accounting for secondary structure and repetitive sequences. 
Conducted a literature review and performed codon optimization using a guided Monte Carlo approach to predict the best transcript for a given gene. 

This project was assigned as part of Bioengineering 134 taught by Chris Anderson. Given a composition of proteins, returns the DNA transcript for all of the compositions combined.
